# Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

The Student Grade Generator is a simple JavaScript program that prompts the user to input a student's marks and outputs the corresponding grade based on the input.

## Learning Goals

- Practice using JavaScript to handle user input and perform conditional logic.
- Understand how to map a range of values to specific outputs.
- Gain familiarity with basic JavaScript syntax and control flow.

## Introduction

The Student Grade Generator is a toy problem designed to simulate a grading system. It allows users to input a student's marks and calculates their corresponding grade based on predefined grade boundaries. The program provides a practical example of how to handle user input, perform conditional checks, and output the results based on specific conditions.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the code files to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.

4. Run the following command to execute the program: node . js

5. The program will prompt you to enter the student's marks. Please enter a numerical value between 0 and 100.

6. After entering the marks, press Enter.

7. The program will process the input and display the corresponding grade for the entered marks. The grades are defined as follows:

- A: Marks greater than 79
- B: Marks between 60 and 79 (inclusive)
- C: Marks between 50 and 59 (inclusive)
- D: Marks between 40 and 49 (inclusive)
- E: Marks less than 40

8. The program will then terminate. You can rerun it and enter different marks to see how the grades change based on the input.

Note: The program performs basic input validation to ensure the entered marks are within the valid range of 0 to 100. If an invalid input is provided, the program will display an error message.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as per your requirements. It provides a starting point for understanding how to handle user input, perform conditional logic, and map input values to specific outputs.

Enjoy using the Student Grade Generator!
